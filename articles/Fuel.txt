Flying consumes fuel. Each aircraft has its own fuel capacity and fuel usage, which can be seen on the
{@article=List_of_aircraft list of aircraft} page. Indicated fuel usage is applicable when throttle is
applied. If the engine(s) is/are idle, the actual fuel usage is 1/5th of the indicated fuel usage.
