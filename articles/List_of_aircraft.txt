{@h4(id="Andromada") Andromada}
{@infoboxright
  {@aimg=andromada.png;Andromada;Andromada}
  <small>Andromada</small>
}

Large cargo plane with four engines. The Andromada has a tailgate which can be opened,
but sadly it's not possible to actually place anything inside its cargo hold.

{@infoboxright
  {@aimg=at-400.png;AT-400;AT-400}
  <small>AT-400</small>
}

Large passenger plane with two engines. The AT-400 is very maneuverable in the air but is unhandy
to taxi with. Getting in might be a challenge, as it requires stairs. Fortunately, players can use the
{@code /at400} command to get warped into the plane when the player is nearby.

Twin-engine propellor passenger plane, for medium distances. Has a fixed landing gear and can perform
landings and takeoffs on grass or dirt, but this requires some skill.

{@b Based on:} Britten-Norman Islander<br/>
{@b Fuel capacity:} 518L<br/>

{@b Fuel capacity:} 144L<br/>
{@b Fuel usage:} 1L/s<br/>
{@b See also:} {@#=Skimmer Skimmer}<br/>

and one attached at the end of the tail.

{@b Based on:} Douglas CC-129 Dakota<br/>
{@b Fuel capacity:} 3224L<br/>
{@b Fuel usage:} 3L/s<br/>
{@b Trivia:} It's named after the American state, as is the plane that it's based on.<br/>

{@b Based on:} Cessna 185<br/>
{@b Fuel capacity:} 144L<br/>
{@b Fuel usage:} 1L/s<br/>
{@b Trivia:} To be able to lift off, the game's FPS may not be higher than 30. 25 is recommended.
One can use the {@code /fpslimit 25} client-side command to do this (make sure the 'FPS limiter' is ON
in the game's display settings).<br/>
